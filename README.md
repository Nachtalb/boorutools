# tgtools

âš  In the middle of development, I don't recommend you use it as of now.

A set of telegram related utilities that I use in multiple projects. Includes
but is not limited to:

- File compatibility for telegram (eg. resizing images etc.)
- Objectified booru posts instead of just dicts etc.
- Telegram tag serialiser
